Playtime with Percy | PATCH 1.1 "THE ROWEN NERF"

Nothing is perfect, here is the first patch of the game!

- Fixed a bug where a lot of the Bonuses tabs on the Main Menu could be clicked if you weren't in the Bonuses menu
- The Pal Boss has been rebalanced. The later Charges should no longer be overwhelmingly hard and somewhat managable, but still difficult overall
- Rowen Rat can no longer move / attack if Percy Poodle or Charlie Cat is attacking
- Rowen Rat now takes +3 seconds longer to attack once he is in one of the four corner rooms
- Fixed a grammar error in the Pal Boss
